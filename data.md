* [Recount](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/) a database of free RNA-seq data sets at the gene count level created by [Alyssa](http://alyssafrazee.com/)
* [Medical Journal P-value Data](https://github.com/jtleek/swfdr/blob/master/pvalueData.rda) - a set of p-values scraped from the abstracts of the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, BMJ, The Lancet, and the Amerian Journal of Epidemiology from 2000-2010 created by Jeff. 
* [Processed GEUVADIS data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kp5th9hgkq8ckom/geuvadisbg.rda) - processed data from 667 RNA-seq samples from the [GEUVADIS](http://www.geuvadis.org/) project created by [Alyssa](http://alyssafrazee.com/)
* [GEUVADIS BAM files](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-GEUV-6/) - processed with Tophat2 and created by [Alyssa](http://alyssafrazee.com/)
* [anitProfiles data](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/antiProfiles.html) - gene expression data from cancer and normal samples used in our paper on [classifying with variance](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/272) created by [Hector](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~hcorrada/).
* [Peer review data](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~jleek/peerreview) - data from our [laboratory experiment of peer review](?) created by Jeff and [Margaret](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~mtaub/About.html)
* [Batch effect data](http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/batch/) - data on batch effects from a range of genomic technologies created by Jeff, [Rafa](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/), [Hector](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~hcorrada/), [Ben](http://www.langmead-lab.org/), [Keith](http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~kabaggerly/), [Evan](http://jlab.bu.edu/), [Rob](http://rscharpf.github.io/index.html), and [David](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-simcha/42/425/788).
* [Bladder batch data](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/bladderbatch.html) - data on batch effects from a study of bladder cancer in expression set format created by Jeff
* [Braincloud](http://braincloud.jhmi.edu) - data from [our paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7370/full/nature10524.html) with [Carlo](http://libd.org/contact/staff-directory/26-carlo-colantuoni) looking at patterns of variation in gene expression in the human brain.
